# flask
Flask webserver and ReST test cases. No guarantee will it work after a checkout. The Python3 installation 
and some Flask libraries were not checked in.

This is a demonstration of developing a web server using python code on Flask,

Some server API were created only to be tested with ReST testcases.

Sample of mocking APIs with python

to have it run, i recommend installing Flash with the same web site and replacing add files: app.py, flask_apis.postman_collection.json
flask_test.py.

I can help if you get blocked or need some information about that.
